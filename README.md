# ✊ Why Not CapCut? Petition

Welcome to the official petition for creators who are DONE settling for glitchy edits, ad walls, and locked-down features. This is the place where we say loud and proud: CapCut just doesn’t cut it. 🚫✂️

If you're tired of:
- 🐌 Slow performance and random crashes
- 🎭 Overhyped filters that scream same-same
- 💸 Premium features that aren’t exactly budget-friendly
- 📵 Lack of serious editing power for real creative freedom

Then follow these steps to sign the petition:

- Fork this repository
- Make a txt in the fork of your repo, named after youre github handle (e.g: yourGitHubHandle.txt)
- In the txt, write this:
  Username: yourGitHubHandle
  Email: your.email@example.com
  Preferred Alternative: [name of editing app or platform]
- Before commiting your changes to your txt file, make sure select "Create a new branch and start a pull request" instead of "Commit directly to the main branch"
- This will send a pull request to this repo, and your txt file will be here once your pull request is merged.

We’re not just here to complain—we’re here to change the game.💥  
**Your voice matters.** Let’s build a better edit experience.
