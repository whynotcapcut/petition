# ✊ Why Not CapCut? Petition

Welcome to the official petition for creators who are DONE settling for glitchy edits, ad walls, and locked-down features. This is the place where we say loud and proud: CapCut just doesn’t cut it. 🚫✂️

If you're tired of:
- 🐌 Slow performance and random crashes
- 🎭 Overhyped filters that scream same-same
- 💸 Premium features that aren’t exactly budget-friendly
- 📵 Lack of serious editing power for real creative freedom

Then sign your name, drop your thoughts, and join the wave.

We’re not just here to complain—we’re here to change the game.💥  
**Your voice matters.** Let’s build a better edit experience.
